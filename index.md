# Welcome to My Cybersecurity Journey

I'm Christian Terrell, a cybersecurity student at Cincinnati State, transitioning from 15 years in photography to the world of offensive security and threat analysis.

## What I'm Doing

I'm dedicating 40 hours a week to mastering cybersecurity fundamentals while building real-world projects that demonstrate my skills. This site documents my learning journey, project walkthroughs, and technical tutorials as I work toward landing my first role as a security analyst or penetration tester.

## What You'll Find Here

**Blog**: Deep dives into cybersecurity concepts, TryHackMe and HackTheBox walkthroughs, and tutorials written from a beginner's perspective for beginners.

**Portfolio**: Homelab projects, security tools I've built, and demonstrations of skills employers are looking for.

**Learning in Public**: I believe in documenting the struggle, not just the success. You'll see what I'm learning, what challenges I'm facing, and how I'm overcoming them.

## Current Focus

- Network security fundamentals
- Linux system administration
- Penetration testing methodologies
- Building a budget homelab for hands-on practice
- IT governance and risk management
