# About Christian Terrell

I'm a cybersecurity student at Cincinnati State with a mission: prove that dedication, resilience, and genuine passion matter more than a perfect resume.

## My Background

For 15 years, I worked as a professional photographer, developing a keen eye for detail and the ability to see what others miss. Now I'm applying that same attention to detail to cybersecurity, where spotting the anomaly can mean the difference between a secure system and a compromised one.

## Why Cybersecurity?

Technology has always fascinated me, but it wasn't until I started exploring cybersecurity that I found my calling. The puzzle-solving aspect, the constant learning, the challenge of thinking like both an attacker and a defender - this is what gets me up in the morning.

I'm not coming from a traditional tech background, and I'm okay with that. What I lack in formal experience, I make up for in work ethic and genuine curiosity. I'm putting in 40 hours a week studying, practicing on TryHackMe and HackTheBox, building homelab projects, and documenting everything I learn.

## What I'm Learning

**Current Coursework (Spring 2026):**
- Network Communications
- IT Governance & Management  
- Statistics for Cybersecurity
- Technical Communication
- Public Speaking

**Self-Directed Learning:**
- Linux system administration
- Penetration testing fundamentals
- Security tool development
- Scripting and automation (Python, Bash)
- Homelab infrastructure on a budget

## My Approach

I believe in learning in public. That means documenting the struggles, not just the wins. It means asking questions when I don't understand something. It means building projects that might fail, troubleshooting them, and sharing what I learned from the failure.

Every blog post on this site represents hours of study, practice, and documentation. I'm not here to pretend I know everything. I'm here to show I can learn anything.

## Beyond the Keyboard

When I'm not deep in cybersecurity studies, you'll find me training my American Staffordshire Terrier, Phineas, staying active in my recovery community (15+ months sober), and volunteering as IT Director for the Center for Spiritual Living Greater Cincinnati. I also do side quest doing minor computer security upgrades and tech repair. Oh and I still practive my art. Now its for my own enjoyment.  

## Let's Connect

I'm actively seeking entry-level cybersecurity analyst positions or red team interns
