# Why I'm Building This Site

Today marks a milestone: launching ChristianTerrell.com as my platform to document the journey from photography professional to cybersecurity analyst. This is the most public thing I have ever done and I may be over my head. But I realized a couple years ago that I can keep playing pretend or I can really learn and really do the labs and really go for it.

## The Challenge I'm Facing

Challenge? None at all.
…Okay, that’s a lie.

I’m a first-year cybersecurity student at Cincinnati State with a wildly non-traditional background. I’ve got 15 years of professional photography experience, zero professional IT experience, and I’m competing against people with CS degrees and industry certifications. So yes—absolutely crushing it on *hard mode*. No big deal.


**What I do have:**
- 40 hours a week dedicated to learning
- Hands-on practice through TryHackMe and HackTheBox
- A homelab I'm building on a tight budget
- The willingness to document every step, including the failures

## Why "Learning in Public" Matters

Most portfolio sites show you the polished final product. I'm doing something different. Every blog post here will show:

1. **What I learned** - The concept, tool, or technique
2. **How I learned it** - The resources, struggles, and breakthroughs  
3. **What I built** - The hands-on project or lab exercise
4. **What went wrong** - Because failures teach more than successes

This approach serves two purposes:
- It helps other beginners who are struggling with the same concepts
- It shows employers I can learn, troubleshoot, and communicate technical concepts

## What's Coming Next

Over the next few weeks, you'll see posts on:
- Setting up my first homelab environment (VirtualBox, Kali Linux, vulnerable VMs)
- Network fundamentals from my Cincinnati State coursework
- TryHackMe room walkthroughs with beginner-friendly explanations
- Tools and techniques I'm learning for penetration testing

## The Tech Behind This Site

This site itself is a learning project:
- **Hosted on**: GitHub Pages (free, professional, shows I understand Git)
- **Built with**: Jekyll static site generator
- **Styled with**: Custom SCSS for that cybersecurity aesthetic
- **Domain**: My own (christianterrell.com, not a subdomain)

Building this from scratch instead of using a template means I understand every piece of it. That's the theme you'll see throughout this journey: deep understanding over shortcuts.
